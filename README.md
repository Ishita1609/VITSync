# VITSync
A responsive frontend project with clean UI and interactive features.
Objective-
The objective of this project is to develop a collaborative platform for VIT college students 
to connect with potential team members for project development. The website will enable 
students to present their work, gain recognition, and seek skilled developers or designers 
for projects in progress. By fostering collaboration, networking, and hands-on experience, 
the platform aims to bridge the gap between aspiring developers and innovative ideas, 
ultimately enhancing studentsâ€™ practical exposure and teamwork skills.
